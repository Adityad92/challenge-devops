**Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**

For ISR, we'll use a combination of Nginx and a Next.js server to handle the static serving and incremental regeneration.

1. Build the Next.js app for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate an optimized production build in the `.next` folder.

2. Create an Nginx configuration file (`nginx.conf`):

```nginx
events {
  worker_connections 1024;
}

http {
  server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
      proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
  }
}
```

This Nginx configuration proxies all requests to the Next.js server running on `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Create a Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM node:14-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

RUN npm run build

ENV NODE_ENV production

CMD ["npm", "start"]

FROM nginx:latest

COPY --from=0 /app/.next /app/.next
COPY --from=0 /app/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```

This multi-stage Dockerfile first builds the Next.js app using the Node.js base image, and then copies the built `.next` folder and the Nginx configuration to the Nginx image.

4. Build and run the Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t my-isr-app .
docker run -p 80:80 my-isr-app
```

This will build the Docker image and run a container that serves the Next.js app with ISR on `http://localhost`. Nginx will proxy requests to the Next.js server, which will serve the static pages and incrementally regenerate the dynamic pages as needed.

In the ISR setup, the Next.js server is responsible for handling the incremental regeneration of pages, while Nginx serves as a reverse proxy and caches the static pages for better performance.

Note that for both SSG and ISR, you'll need to configure the appropriate settings in your Next.js app to specify which pages should be statically generated and which pages should use ISR. You can refer to the Next.js documentation for more information on these settings.

Additionally, in a production environment, you might want to separate the Nginx and Next.js server into different containers for better scalability and resource management, and possibly add a load balancer or reverse proxy in front of the containers for better load handling and failover.

These examples should give you a good starting point for setting up production-ready Static Site Generation (SSG) and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) applications using Next.js, Docker, and Nginx. You can further customize the configurations based on your specific requirements, such as adding HTTPS support, configuring caching, or setting up a reverse proxy.
