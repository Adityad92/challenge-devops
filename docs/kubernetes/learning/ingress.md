Below is an example of an advanced Kubernetes Ingress YAML file with comments explaining each section. This Ingress resource is designed to route external HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the `mywebapp` Service.  
   
Please note that in order to use an Ingress in Kubernetes, you must have an Ingress controller running in the cluster. The specific annotations and configuration details may vary depending on the Ingress controller you use (e.g., nginx, traefik, HAProxy, etc.).  
   
```yaml  
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1              # The API version for the Ingress  
kind: Ingress                                 # The kind of the Kubernetes resource  
metadata:  
  name: mywebapp-ingress                      # The name of the Ingress  
  namespace: mywebapp-namespace               # The namespace that the Ingress belongs to  
  annotations:  
    # Ingress class to use. This must match the class of the Ingress controller.  
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx"  
    # Enable client certificate authentication  
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-tls-verify-client: "on"  
    # Specify the secret that contains the trusted CA certificates  
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-tls-secret: "mywebapp-namespace/ca-secret"  
    # Enable CORS and set allowed origins  
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors: "true"  
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/cors-allow-origin: "https://example.com"  
    # Use a custom error page hosted in a ConfigMap  
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/custom-http-errors: "404,500"  
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/error-pages-configmap: "mywebapp-namespace/custom-error-pages"  
spec:  
  tls:                                       # TLS settings for HTTPS  
    - hosts:  
        - mywebapp.example.com  
      secretName: mywebapp-tls-cert          # Secret that contains the TLS certificate and key  
  rules:  
    - host: mywebapp.example.com             # Hostname to route traffic for  
      http:  
        paths:  
          - path: /                          # Path to route traffic to  
            pathType: Prefix                 # Specifies how to match the path  
            backend:  
              service:  
                name: mywebapp-service       # The name of the Service to route traffic to  
                port:  
                  number: 80                 # The port number of the Service to route traffic to  
```  
   
This advanced Ingress configuration includes the following features:  
   
- `apiVersion`: Specifies the API version for the Ingress resource.  
- `kind`: Specifies the kind of resource, which is Ingress in this case.  
- `metadata`: Contains metadata about the Ingress, such as its name and namespace.  
- `annotations`: Provides additional configuration options specific to the Ingress controller.  
- `tls`: Contains the configuration for TLS, including the hosts it applies to and the Kubernetes Secret containing the TLS certificate and key.  
- `rules`: Defines how to route incoming HTTP(S) traffic based on hostnames and paths.  
- `host`: Specifies the domain that the Ingress will route traffic for.  
- `http`: Contains the rules for routing HTTP traffic.  
- `paths`: Lists the paths that should be routed to the backend service.  
- `pathType`: Specifies how the path is matched (e.g., `Prefix`, `Exact`).  
- `backend`: Defines the backend service and port to route traffic to.  
   
Remember, the annotations used in this example are specific to the nginx Ingress controller. If you are using a different Ingress controller, you will need to adjust the annotations accordingly. Also, the `mywebapp-tls-cert` Secret should exist in the same namespace and contain the appropriate TLS certificate and key for the domain you're securing.  
   
Before applying this Ingress resource, you must ensure that you have a compatible Ingress controller deployed
