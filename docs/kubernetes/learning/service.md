Below is an example of an advanced Kubernetes Service YAML file with comments explaining each section. This Service is designed to expose the previously mentioned `mywebapp` Deployment. Please note that understanding this Service configuration requires familiarity with Kubernetes Services, including concepts like ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, and selectors.  
   
```yaml  
apiVersion: v1                           # The API version for the Service  
kind: Service                            # The kind of the Kubernetes resource  
metadata:  
  name: mywebapp-service                 # The name of the Service  
  labels:  
    app: mywebapp                        # Labels to apply to the Service for identification  
spec:  
  type: LoadBalancer                     # The type of Service: ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer  
  selector:  
    app: mywebapp                        # The selector to match the Pods that this Service will route traffic to  
  ports:  
    - name: http                         # The name of this port within the Service definition  
      protocol: TCP                      # The protocol used by the Service (TCP/UDP)  
      port: 80                           # The port that the Service will serve on  
      targetPort: 8080                   # The target port on the Pod to forward traffic to  
      nodePort: 30080                    # The port that will be opened on every node for NodePort access (only needed if type is NodePort or LoadBalancer)  
  sessionAffinity: ClientIP              # Controls session affinity, can be None or ClientIP  
  externalTrafficPolicy: Local           # Denotes if external traffic is routed to node-local or cluster-wide endpoints  
  loadBalancerIP: 192.0.2.1              # Requests a specific load balancer IP (only applies if supported by the cloud provider)  
  loadBalancerSourceRanges:              # Optionally restrict traffic sources to specific IP ranges  
    - "192.0.2.0/24"  
  externalName: mywebapp.example.com     # The external reference that the Service will point to (only applies if type is ExternalName)  
  healthCheckNodePort: 30200             # Specifies the health check node port (only necessary if type is LoadBalancer and externalTrafficPolicy is set to Local)  
  publishNotReadyAddresses: true         # If true, services can route to pods when they are not ready  
   
# Note: Not all fields are necessary for all Service types. For example, if you are creating a ClusterIP  
# type Service, you wouldn't specify `nodePort`, `loadBalancerIP`, `loadBalancerSourceRanges`, or `externalName`.  
```  
   
This Service definition includes several advanced options:  
   
- `type`: Specifies the type of Service. `LoadBalancer` type automatically creates a cloud provider's load balancer to route external traffic to the Service.  
- `selector`: Maps the Service to the Pods. It should match the labels on the Pods you want to expose.  
- `ports`: Defines the ports that the Service will expose. Multiple ports can be defined if needed.  
- `sessionAffinity`: Controls whether the Service should maintain session affinity.  
- `externalTrafficPolicy`: Determines if traffic should be routed to node-local endpoints only, preserving the original source IP address.  
- `loadBalancerIP`: Allows you to request a specific IP address for the load balancer (if your cloud provider supports this feature).  
- `loadBalancerSourceRanges`: Restricts traffic through the load balancer to certain IP ranges.  
- `externalName`: Defines an external reference that the Service will point to, used for type `ExternalName` Services.  
- `healthCheckNodePort`: Used to specify a health check node port for LoadBalancer Services with `externalTrafficPolicy` set to `Local`.  
- `publishNotReadyAddresses`: Allows traffic to Pods that have not yet passed their readiness checks.  
   
Remember that not all fields are used with every type of Service. You should adjust the fields based on your specific use case
