In Kubernetes, networking is a broad topic that involves several kinds of resources, such as Services, Ingress, NetworkPolicies, and more. Below is an example of an advanced NetworkPolicy YAML file with comments that explain each section. This NetworkPolicy might be used to control the ingress and egress traffic for a set of Pods within a Kubernetes cluster.  
   
```yaml  
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1              # The API version for the NetworkPolicy  
kind: NetworkPolicy                           # The kind of the Kubernetes resource  
metadata:  
  name: mywebapp-network-policy               # The name of the NetworkPolicy  
  namespace: mywebapp-namespace               # The namespace that the NetworkPolicy belongs to  
spec:  
  podSelector:                                # Specifies the group of pods to which the policy applies  
    matchLabels:  
      app: mywebapp  
  policyTypes:                                # Specifies the types of traffic the policy applies to (Ingress, Egress, or both)  
    - Ingress  
    - Egress  
  ingress:                                    # Rules for incoming traffic  
    - from:                                   # Defines the sources which are allowed to access the pods  
      - ipBlock:                              # Allows traffic from specific IP ranges  
          cidr: 192.168.0.0/16  
          except:  
            - 192.168.1.0/24  
      - namespaceSelector:                    # Allows traffic from pods in specific namespaces  
          matchLabels:  
            project: myproject  
      - podSelector:                          # Allows traffic from pods with specific labels  
          matchLabels:  
            role: frontend  
      ports:                                  # The ports and protocols that the ingress rule applies to  
      - protocol: TCP  
        port: 80  
  egress:                                     # Rules for outgoing traffic  
    - to:                                     # Defines the destinations that pods can send traffic to  
      - ipBlock:                              # Allows traffic to specific IP ranges  
          cidr: 0.0.0.0/0  
      ports:                                  # The ports and protocols that the egress rule applies to  
      - protocol: TCP  
        port: 443                             # Typically used for HTTPS traffic  
```  
   
This NetworkPolicy example includes the following advanced features:  
   
- `namespace`: The namespace in which the NetworkPolicy is defined. This restricts the policy to affecting resources within the same namespace.  
- `podSelector`: Identifies the group of pods to which the policy applies.  
- `policyTypes`: Specifies the types of network traffic the policy will control.  
- `ingress`: Contains rules that define which incoming traffic is allowed.  
- `from`: Specifies sources from which ingress traffic is allowed. This can include IP blocks, namespaces, and pods.  
- `ipBlock`: Allows defining CIDR ranges for source or destination IPs and supports exceptions.  
- `namespaceSelector`: Allows traffic from all pods in namespaces that match the label selector.  
- `podSelector`: Allows traffic from specific pods that match the label selector within the namespace defined in the policy.  
- `ports`: Defines which ports and protocols are subject to the ingress or egress rules.  
- `egress`: Contains rules that define which outgoing traffic is allowed.  
- `to`: Specifies destinations to which egress traffic is allowed, similar to the `from` field for ingress.  
   
Please note that you should adjust the CIDR ranges, namespace labels, and pod labels to match the actual configuration and requirements of your Kubernetes environment. Additionally, if you're looking to learn about other networking aspects like Services, Ingress, or DNS configuration, each of those topics would be covered by different types of Kubernetes resources and configuration files.
