# kubernetes

The 80-20 principle, also known as the Pareto Principle, suggests that roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. Applied to learning Kubernetes, this would mean focusing on the core 20% of concepts and tasks that will give you 80% of the functionality and understanding you need to work effectively.  
   
Here are the essential concepts and tasks you should focus on when learning Kubernetes, especially when working with a local cluster managed by KIND (Kubernetes IN Docker):  
   
1. **Kubernetes Architecture:**  
   - Understand the basic components of a Kubernetes cluster: nodes, pods, services, and persistent storage.  
   - Learn about the master node components: API server, scheduler, controller manager, etcd.  
   - Understand worker node components: kubelet, kube-proxy, and container runtime.  
   
2. **Pods:**  
   - Learn how to create and manage pods.  
   - Understand the lifecycle of a pod and how it relates to containers.  
   
3. **Deployments and ReplicaSets:**  
   - Understand how Deployments manage the desired state of your application.  
   - Learn how ReplicaSets ensure a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.  
   
4. **Services:**  
   - Know how to expose your application using Services.  
   - Learn the differences between ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer service types.  
   
5. **Networking:**  
   - Grasp the basics of how networking works in Kubernetes, including how pods communicate with each other and with services.  
   
6. **Ingress:**  
   - Learn how to expose services to the outside world using Ingress controllers and resources.  
   
7. **ConfigMaps and Secrets:**  
   - Understand how to externalize configuration using ConfigMaps and how to manage sensitive information with Secrets.  
   
8. **Volumes and Persistent Storage:**  
   - Learn about volumes and how they allow data to persist beyond the life of a pod.  
   - Understand the basics of PersistentVolumes (PVs) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs).  
   
9. **Namespaces:**  
   - Get familiar with namespaces to organize resources within the cluster.  
   
10. **kubectl:**  
    - Become proficient with the `kubectl` command-line tool for interacting with the Kubernetes cluster.  
   
11. **Logging and Monitoring:**  
    - Understand the basics of application and cluster-level logging.  
    - Learn about monitoring tools that can be integrated with Kubernetes.  
   
12. **Helm:**  
    - Learn about Helm, the package manager for Kubernetes, to manage applications.  
   
13. **Basic Troubleshooting:**  
    - Learn how to troubleshoot common issues in pods and services.  
   
14. **Security:**  
    - Understand basic security practices, including role-based access control (RBAC), network policies, and security contexts.  
   
15. **Application Lifecycle Management:**  
    - Learn how to perform rolling updates and rollbacks of applications.  

16. **scheduling and node management:**
    - **Taints** are applied to nodes and mark them so that no pods will schedule onto them unless those pods have a matching toleration. Taints consist of a key, value, and effect. The effect determines what happens to pods that do not tolerate the taint. There are currently three possible effects:  
    - `NoSchedule`: Pods that do not tolerate this taint are not scheduled on the node.  
    - `PreferNoSchedule`: The Kubernetes scheduler tries to avoid placing a pod that does not tolerate this taint on the node, but it is not guaranteed.  
    - `NoExecute`: Pods that do not tolerate this taint are evicted from the node if they are already running on it, and are not scheduled on it in the future.  
    
    - **Tolerations** are applied to pods and allow (but do not require) the pods to schedule onto nodes with matching taints. Tolerations correspond to taints; a pod with a toleration is immune to the taint's effect.  
    
    When you are learning Kubernetes, understanding taints and tolerations is important for scenarios where you need to ensure that certain pods are not scheduled on inappropriate nodes. For example, you might want to dedicate certain nodes for specific workloads such as high-memory applications, or you might want to prevent pods from being scheduled on a node that is reserved for system or management tasks.  
    
    To summarize, taints and tolerations are advanced scheduling features in Kubernetes that help ensure pods are scheduled appropriately across the cluster's nodes. These are part of the more nuanced features of Kubernetes, which you might explore after grasping the foundational concepts listed earlier. They fit into the category of learning how Kubernetes manages workloads and resources, which is crucial for more advanced users such as cluster administrators or those looking to fine-tune the behavior of their clusters.

    1. **Node Selector:**  
    Node selectors are a simple way to constrain pods to nodes with specific labels. You can add a `nodeSelector` field to your pod specification with a map of key-value pairs. Only nodes with matching labels will be eligible to run the pod.  
    
    2. **Affinity and Anti-Affinity:**  
    Affinity and anti-affinity expand upon the idea of node selectors with more expressive rules. They allow you to specify rules that limit which nodes your pod can be scheduled on based on the labels on nodes and other pods.  
    - **Node Affinity:** Like node selectors, but allows you to specify sets of rules that are more flexible.  
    - **Pod Affinity and Anti-Affinity:** Allows you to specify rules about how pods should be placed relative to other pods, such as co-locating pods from the same service or separating pods from different services.  
    
    3. **Resource Requests and Limits:**  
    When you specify resource requests and limits in your pod specifications, Kubernetes' scheduler uses this information to decide where to place the pod. Nodes must have enough free resources to meet the resource requests of a pod for it to be scheduled on that node.  
    
    4. **Custom Scheduler:**  
    You can also write your custom scheduler if the default Kubernetes scheduler does not meet your needs. With a custom scheduler, you can implement complex scheduling algorithms tailored to your application.  
    
    5. **Priority and Preemption:**  
    You can set priorities for your pods, and the scheduler will take these priorities into account when deciding which pods to schedule. When a cluster is out of resources, Kubernetes can preempt (evict) lower-priority pods to make room for higher-priority pods that need to be scheduled.  
    
    6. **Topology Spread Constraints:**  
    This feature allows you to control how pods are spread across your cluster among failure-domains such as regions, zones, nodes, and other user-defined topology domains. It ensures that pods are evenly distributed, which is useful for high-availability and fault tolerance.  
    
    7. **DaemonSets:**  
    While not a direct scheduling feature, DaemonSets ensure that a copy of a pod runs on all (or some) nodes in the cluster. The DaemonSet controller bypasses the typical scheduler, placing pods directly onto nodes according to the DaemonSet's configuration.  
   
Understanding and using these scheduling features effectively can help you optimize the placement of workloads within your Kubernetes cluster based on your specific requirements for performance, fault tolerance, availability, and resource utilization.




While the topics covered earlier form the core of what you need to know to work effectively with Kubernetes, there are additional advanced topics and concepts that you may want to explore as you become more proficient. Some of these include:  
   
1. **StatefulSets:**  
   Learn about managing stateful applications, which have unique requirements such as stable, unique network identifiers, stable persistent storage, and ordered, graceful deployment and scaling.  
   
2. **Jobs and CronJobs:**  
   Understand how to run tasks to completion (Jobs) or schedule them to run periodically or at a specific time (CronJobs).  
   
3. **Operators and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):**  
   Discover how to extend Kubernetes functionality using custom resources and operators, which are custom controllers that can manage complex stateful applications.  
   
4. **Service Mesh:**  
   Explore service meshes like Istio or Linkerd, which provide advanced networking features such as service discovery, load balancing, encryption, observability, and traceability.

Continuously monitoring the Kubernetes project and community is also valuable, as new features, updates, and best practices are regularly introduced. Depending on your specific role (e.g., developer, admin, DevOps engineer), some of these topics may be more relevant than others. Always prioritize learning based on your needs and the problems you are trying to solve.
