**6. Data Processing Script:**

* **Project:** Write a script that processes data from a file or a database (e.g., CSV file, JSON file). This script can:
    * Parse data from the source.
    * Perform transformations (e.g., filtering, aggregation).
    * Output the processed data to a new file or a database.
* **Learning:**  This project introduces you to file I/O, data parsing, working with databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), and data manipulation.
