Creating a complete Currency Conversion API involves several steps, including setting up the server, defining endpoints, integrating with an external currency exchange rate service, and handling requests and responses. As a beginner in Golang, you'll want to start with the basics. Below is a simplified example of how you could start building a Currency Conversion API in Go using the `net/http` package for handling HTTP requests and a mock exchange rate for demonstration purposes.  
   
First, ensure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from the official Go website.  
   
Next, create a new directory for your project and create a file named `main.go`. Open the file in your favorite text editor and add the following code:  
   
```go  
package main  
   
import (  
	"encoding/json"  
	"log"  
	"net/http"  
	"strconv"  
)  
   
// Mock data for currency exchange rates  
var exchangeRates = map[string]float64{  
	"USD": 1.0,  
	"EUR": 0.9,  
	"GBP": 0.8,  
	"JPY": 110.0,  
}  
   
// CurrencyConversionResponse represents the JSON structure for the API response  
type CurrencyConversionResponse struct {  
	From   string  `json:"from"`  
	To     string  `json:"to"`  
	Amount float64 `json:"amount"`  
	Result float64 `json:"result"`  
}  
   
// convertCurrency handles the conversion request and returns the result  
func convertCurrency(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
	// Parse query parameters  
	from := r.URL.Query().Get("from")  
	to := r.URL.Query().Get("to")  
	amountStr := r.URL.Query().Get("amount")  
  
	// Convert amount to float64  
	amount, err := strconv.ParseFloat(amountStr, 64)  
	if err != nil {  
		http.Error(w, "Invalid amount", http.StatusBadRequest)  
		return  
	}  
  
	// Perform the conversion  
	fromRate, fromExists := exchangeRates[from]  
	toRate, toExists := exchangeRates[to]  
	if !fromExists || !toExists {  
		http.Error(w, "Invalid currency code", http.StatusBadRequest)  
		return  
	}  
	result := (amount / fromRate) * toRate  
  
	// Create the response  
	response := CurrencyConversionResponse{  
		From:   from,  
		To:     to,  
		Amount: amount,  
		Result: result,  
	}  
  
	// Set the content type to JSON  
	w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")  
  
	// Encode and send the response  
	json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(response)  
}  
   
func main() {  
	http.HandleFunc("/convert", convertCurrency)  
  
	log.Println("Starting server on port 8080...")  
	if err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil); err != nil {  
		log.Fatal(err)  
	}  
}  
```  
   
To run your API, execute the following command in your terminal:  
   
```sh  
go run main.go  
```  
   
Your Currency Conversion API is now running on `localhost:8080`. You can test it by navigating to the following URL in your browser or using a tool like `curl`:  
   
```  
http://localhost:8080/convert?from=USD&to=EUR&amount=100  
```  
   
This should return a JSON response with the converted currency amount.  
   
Please note that this is a simplified example intended for educational purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would need to integrate with a live currency exchange rate API (like Open Exchange Rates or CurrencyLayer) to get real-time conversion rates, handle errors more robustly, and potentially add authentication for security.
