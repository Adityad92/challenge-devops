Creating a Recipe API involves setting up endpoints that allow users to search for recipes and retrieve details about them. For this example, we'll create a simple in-memory database and a couple of endpoints: one to add new recipes and another to list all recipes. This will be a simplified demonstration suitable for a beginner in Go.  
   
First, make sure you have Go installed and create a new directory for your project. Inside this directory, create a new file named `main.go`. Open this file in your text editor and follow the steps below.  
   
Here's the basic structure of the code:  
   
```go  
package main  
   
import (  
	"encoding/json"  
	"log"  
	"net/http"  
	"sync"  
)  
   
// Recipe represents the structure for a recipe  
type Recipe struct {  
	ID          int      `json:"id"`  
	Name        string   `json:"name"`  
	Ingredients []string `json:"ingredients"`  
	Instructions string   `json:"instructions"`  
}  
   
// RecipeBook holds a collection of recipes  
type RecipeBook struct {  
	sync.Mutex  
	Recipes []Recipe `json:"recipes"`  
}  
   
// Initialize our in-memory recipe book  
var recipeBook = RecipeBook{}  
   
// nextID keeps track of the next ID to be assigned to a new recipe  
var nextID = 1  
```  
   
Now, let's create handlers for adding and listing recipes:  
   
```go  
// ListRecipes sends a list of all recipes as JSON  
func ListRecipes(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
	recipeBook.Lock()  
	defer recipeBook.Unlock()  
  
	w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")  
	json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(recipeBook)  
}  
   
// AddRecipe adds a new recipe to the recipe book  
func AddRecipe(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
	var recipe Recipe  
  
	if r.Method != http.MethodPost {  
		http.Error(w, "Method not allowed", http.StatusMethodNotAllowed)  
		return  
	}  
  
	// Decode the incoming recipe JSON  
	err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&recipe)  
	if err != nil {  
		http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)  
		return  
	}  
  
	recipeBook.Lock()  
	// Assign an ID to the recipe  
	recipe.ID = nextID  
	nextID++  
	// Add the recipe to the book  
	recipeBook.Recipes = append(recipeBook.Recipes, recipe)  
	recipeBook.Unlock()  
  
	w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")  
	w.WriteHeader(http.StatusCreated)  
	json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(recipe)  
}  
```  
   
Set up the HTTP server and routes:  
   
```go  
func main() {  
	http.HandleFunc("/recipes", ListRecipes)  
	http.HandleFunc("/recipe", AddRecipe)  
  
	log.Println("Server starting on port 8080...")  
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))  
}  
```  
   
Run your Recipe API by executing the following command in your terminal:  
   
```sh  
go run main.go  
```  
   
Your API is now running on `localhost:8080`. You can test it using `curl`:  
   
List all recipes:  
```sh  
curl http://localhost:8080/recipes  
```  
   
Add a new recipe:  
```sh  
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Pancakes","ingredients":["Eggs","Flour","Milk"],"instructions":"Mix ingredients and cook on a skillet."}' http://localhost:8080/recipe  
```  
   
Again, this is a very basic example and does not include features like searching for recipes by ingredients, handling updates or deletions, or persisting data across server restarts. In a real-world application, you would use a database for storage, add authentication, create more endpoints (e.g., to retrieve a single recipe or to update and delete recipes), and provide detailed error handling.
