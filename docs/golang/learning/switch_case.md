Let's dive into `switch` statements and "fallthrough" behavior in Go!

**1. Basic Switch Statement**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
        day := "Tuesday"

        switch day {
        case "Monday":
                fmt.Println("Ugh, start of the work week.")
        case "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday": // Multiple cases can be combined
                fmt.Println("Working hard!")
        case "Friday":
                fmt.Println("TGIF!")
        case "Saturday", "Sunday":
                fmt.Println("Weekend vibes!")
        default: // Optional default case
                fmt.Println("Invalid day")
        }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The value of `day` is compared to each `case`.
- If a match is found, the code within that `case` is executed.
- If no match, the `default` case runs (if present).

**2. Switch with Expression**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
        score := 85

        switch { // No expression after 'switch'
        case score >= 90:
                fmt.Println("Grade: A")
        case score >= 80:
                fmt.Println("Grade: B")
        case score >= 70:
                fmt.Println("Grade: C")
        default:
                fmt.Println("Grade: F")
        }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Without an expression after `switch`, cases become boolean expressions.
- The first `true` case is executed.

**3. Fallthrough: The Unusual Case**

- Unlike `switch` in some other languages, Go's `switch` doesn't automatically "fall through" to the next case.
- If you **want** fallthrough behavior, you use the `fallthrough` keyword.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
        number := 3

        switch number {
        case 3:
                fmt.Println("Number is 3")
                fallthrough // Execution will continue to the next case!
        case 4:
                fmt.Println("Number is 3 or 4") // This will also print when number is 3
        case 5:
                fmt.Println("Number is 5")
        }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Number is 3
Number is 3 or 4 
```

**Caution with Fallthrough:**

- `fallthrough` is rarely used and can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully. It's generally best to structure your cases to avoid it.

**Key Points:**

- `switch` provides a cleaner way to handle multiple conditional checks than a series of `if-else if` statements.
- Go's `switch` doesn't fall through by default. Use `fallthrough` explicitly (and cautiously) if needed. 
- Each case is exclusive unless `fallthrough` is used.
