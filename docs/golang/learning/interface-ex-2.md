Certainly! Let's use a different example and show the code side by side. We'll create a simple audio player system that can play different types of audio files.

First, let's look at the implementation without interfaces:

```go
// Without Interfaces

type MP3 struct {
    Title string
}

func (m MP3) PlayMP3() {
    fmt.Println("Playing MP3:", m.Title)
}

type WAV struct {
    Title string
}

func (w WAV) PlayWAV() {
    fmt.Println("Playing WAV:", w.Title)
}

type FLAC struct {
    Title string
}

func (f FLAC) PlayFLAC() {
    fmt.Println("Playing FLAC:", f.Title)
}

func PlayAudio(audioType string, audio interface{}) {
    switch audioType {
    case "mp3":
        audio.(MP3).PlayMP3()
    case "wav":
        audio.(WAV).PlayWAV()
    case "flac":
        audio.(FLAC).PlayFLAC()
    default:
        fmt.Println("Unsupported audio type")
    }
}

func main() {
    mp3 := MP3{Title: "Song1.mp3"}
    wav := WAV{Title: "Song2.wav"}
    flac := FLAC{Title: "Song3.flac"}

    PlayAudio("mp3", mp3)
    PlayAudio("wav", wav)
    PlayAudio("flac", flac)
}
```

Now, let's implement the same functionality using interfaces:

```go
// With Interfaces

type AudioPlayer interface {
    Play()
}

type MP3 struct {
    Title string
}

func (m MP3) Play() {
    fmt.Println("Playing MP3:", m.Title)
}

type WAV struct {
    Title string
}

func (w WAV) Play() {
    fmt.Println("Playing WAV:", w.Title)
}

type FLAC struct {
    Title string
}

func (f FLAC) Play() {
    fmt.Println("Playing FLAC:", f.Title)
}

func PlayAudio(player AudioPlayer) {
    player.Play()
}

func main() {
    mp3 := MP3{Title: "Song1.mp3"}
    wav := WAV{Title: "Song2.wav"}
    flac := FLAC{Title: "Song3.flac"}

    PlayAudio(mp3)
    PlayAudio(wav)
    PlayAudio(flac)
}
```

Key differences and benefits of using interfaces:

1. Simplicity: The interface version has a single `PlayAudio` function that works for all audio types, while the non-interface version needs a switch statement to handle different types.

2. Extensibility: To add a new audio format (e.g., AAC) in the interface version, we just need to create a new struct that implements the `Play()` method. In the non-interface version, we'd need to add a new case to the switch statement in `PlayAudio`.

3. Type Safety: The interface version ensures at compile-time that all audio types have a `Play()` method. The non-interface version uses type assertions, which can panic at runtime if the wrong type is passed.

4. Decoupling: In the interface version, the `PlayAudio` function doesn't need to know about the specific types of audio files. It only knows about the `AudioPlayer` interface.

5. Testability: It's easier to create mock audio players for testing with the interface version.

6. Code Reusability: The interface version allows us to write functions that can work with any type that satisfies the `AudioPlayer` interface, promoting code reuse.

This side-by-side comparison shows how interfaces can lead to more flexible, maintainable, and extensible code. The interface-based approach allows us to focus on the behavior (playing audio) rather than the specific types of audio files.
