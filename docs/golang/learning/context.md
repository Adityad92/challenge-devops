The `context` package in Go is used to carry deadlines, cancellation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and between processes. Understanding and using the `context` package effectively is essential for writing reliable and maintainable concurrent code in Go.  
   
Here's an overview of the `context` package following the 80-20 principle, where 20% of the concepts you learn will cover 80% of your use cases:  
   
### Core Concepts  
   
1. **Context Types**:  
   - `context.Background()`: The root context, which is never canceled and has no values or deadlines. It is typically used in main functions, initialization, and tests.  
   - `context.TODO()`: A placeholder context when you're unsure what to use or plan to add a proper context later.  
   
2. **Deriving Contexts**:  
   - `context.WithCancel(parent Context)`: Creates a new context that you can cancel manually using the `cancel()` function it returns.  
   - `context.WithDeadline(parent Context, deadline time.Time)`: Creates a context that automatically cancels at the specified deadline time.  
   - `context.WithTimeout(parent Context, timeout time.Duration)`: Similar to `WithDeadline` but specifies a duration after which to cancel, starting from now.  
   - `context.WithValue(parent Context, key, val interface{})`: Creates a context that carries a key-value pair. It's used to pass request-scoped data.  
   
### Common Scenarios  
   
1. **Timeouts**: Use `context.WithTimeout` to prevent your application from hanging indefinitely. For example, set a timeout on HTTP requests or database calls.  
   
2. **Cancellation Propagation**: Use `context.WithCancel` when you need to stop work in a goroutine based on an external event, like user cancellation or shutdown signals.  
   
3. **Request-scoped Data**: Use `context.WithValue` to pass data that is specific to a request's lifecycle, such as authentication credentials or trace IDs.  
   
4. **Deadlines**: Use `context.WithDeadline` when you have a fixed point in time by which the work must be completed, such as a timestamp indicating when a reservation expires.  
   
### Best Practices  
   
- Always pass context as the first parameter of a function.  
- Contexts should not be stored in structures; they should be passed along the call stack.  
- Values stored in context with `context.WithValue` should be used sparingly and only for data that is truly request-scoped.  
- Avoid using `context.TODO()` as a long-term solution; it's intended as a temporary placeholder.  
   
### Example Usage  
   
Here's an example of how you might use a context with a timeout in a hypothetical function that makes an HTTP request:  
   
```go  
package main  
   
import (  
    "context"  
    "fmt"  
    "net/http"  
    "time"  
)  
   
func fetchWithTimeout(ctx context.Context, url string) (*http.Response, error) {  
    // Create a new context with a timeout of 2 seconds  
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, 2*time.Second)  
    defer cancel() // Make sure to cancel the context to free resources  
  
    // Make a request with the context  
    req, _ := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, http.MethodGet, url, nil)  
    client := &http.Client{}  
    return client.Do(req)  
}  
   
func main() {  
    ctx := context.Background() // Use background context as the root  
  
    // Call fetchWithTimeout and pass the context  
    resp, err := fetchWithTimeout(ctx, "http://example.com")  
    if err != nil {  
        fmt.Println("Request failed:", err)  
        return  
    }  
    defer resp.Body.Close() // Don't forget to close the response body  
  
    fmt.Println("Response status code:", resp.StatusCode)  
}  
```  
   
In this example, `fetchWithTimeout` will cancel the HTTP request if it takes longer than 2 seconds. This is a common pattern to prevent your application from hanging indefinitely if an external resource is slow or unresponsive.  
   
### Advanced Usage  
   
Sometimes, you'll want to combine contexts or react to their cancellation. Here's a more advanced example that demonstrates waiting for multiple contexts to be done using `select`:  
   
```go  
package main  
   
import (  
	"context"  
	"fmt"  
	"time"  
)  
   
func operation1(ctx context.Context) {  
	select {  
	case <-time.After(2 * time.Second):  
		fmt.Println("Operation 1 completed")  
	case <-ctx.Done():  
		fmt.Println("Operation 1 cancelled")  
	}  
}  
   
func operation2(ctx context.Context) {  
	select {  
	case <-time.After(100 * time.Millisecond):  
		fmt.Println("Operation 2 completed")  
	case <-ctx.Done():  
		fmt.Println("Operation 2 cancelled")  
	}  
}  
   
func main() {  
	// Root context  
	rootCtx := context.Background()  
  
	// Context with a timeout, all operations must be done within this time frame  
	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(rootCtx, 1*time.Second)  
	defer cancel()  
  
	// Run two operations with the same context  
	go operation1(ctx)  
	go operation2(ctx)  
  
	// Wait for the context to be cancelled (i.e., when the timeout is reached)  
	<-ctx.Done()  
  
	// The ctx.Err() will contain the reason why the context was cancelled  
	fmt.Println("Main: all operations done or cancelled due to", ctx.Err())  
}  
```  
   
In this example, `operation1` and `operation2` are simulated operations that will complete after a certain amount of time or when the context is cancelled, whichever comes first. The main function creates a context with a 1-second timeout and launches both operations with this context. When the timeout is reached, the context's `Done` channel is closed, and the operations are cancelled if they haven't completed yet. The main function then prints the reason for the cancellation, which would be a deadline exceeded error in this case.  
   
### Understanding Cancellation  
   
It's important to understand that cancelling a context does not stop the goroutines that are running; it merely signals them to stop. It's up to the goroutine to respect the context's `Done` channel and cease operations in a timely manner. This means you must always check for context cancellation in any potentially long-running or blocking operations.  
   
### Context in Real-world Applications  
   
In real-world applications, context is often used to manage cancellation and timeouts across API boundaries, such as:  
   
- In HTTP servers, to handle request cancellation and set request deadlines.  
- In gRPC, where each RPC call has its own context passed to it that can be used to control the lifecycle of that RPC.  
- In cloud services clients, to set deadlines for cloud operations and to pass cancellation signals to long-running tasks.  
   
By using the context package properly, you can write robust and concurrent code that gracefully handles cancellation, deadlines, and passing request-scoped values.
