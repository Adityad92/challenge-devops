Let's illustrate how `break` and `continue` work within Go's looping constructs (`for` loop) using clear examples.

**1. `break` Statement**

- **Purpose:** Exits the loop entirely, even if the loop condition would normally continue.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
        for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
                if i == 3 {
                        fmt.Println("Breaking the loop at i =", i)
                        break 
                }
                fmt.Println("Iteration:", i)
        }
        fmt.Println("Loop finished")
}
```

**Output:**

```
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
Breaking the loop at i = 3
Loop finished 
```

**Explanation:**
- The loop iterates from 1 to 5.
- When `i` reaches 3, the `if` condition is met.
- The `break` statement immediately terminates the `for` loop, and execution jumps to the line after the loop (`fmt.Println("Loop finished")`).

**2. `continue` Statement**

- **Purpose:** Skips the current iteration of the loop and jumps to the next iteration.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
        for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
                if i == 3 {
                        fmt.Println("Skipping iteration:", i)
                        continue 
                }
                fmt.Println("Processing iteration:", i)
        }
        fmt.Println("Loop finished")
}
```

**Output:**

```
Processing iteration: 1
Processing iteration: 2
Skipping iteration: 3
Processing iteration: 4
Processing iteration: 5
Loop finished
```

**Explanation:**
- The loop iterates from 1 to 5.
- When `i` is 3, the `if` condition is met.
- `continue` is executed, preventing the code within the current iteration from running (so "Processing iteration: 3" is not printed).
- The loop jumps back to the beginning, incrementing `i` to 4 and continuing the process.

**Key Points:**

- **`break` Exits the Loop:** Use `break` when you want to stop the loop completely based on a specific condition.
- **`continue` Skips to the Next Iteration:** Use `continue` when you want to skip processing the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next.

**Nested Loops:**
- In nested loops, `break` and `continue` only affect the innermost loop they are placed in.
