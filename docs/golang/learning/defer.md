### Regarding `defer`:

`defer` is used to ensure that a function call is performed later in a program's execution, usually for clean-up purposes. It's typically used in the following scenarios:

1. File handling: To ensure files are closed after operations are complete.

   ```go
   file, err := os.Open("file.txt")
   if err != nil {
       log.Fatal(err)
   }
   defer file.Close()
   // Rest of the function...
   ```

2. Mutex unlocking:

   ```go
   mu.Lock()
   defer mu.Unlock()
   // Critical section...
   ```

3. Closing database connections:

   ```go
   conn, err := db.Connect()
   if err != nil {
       log.Fatal(err)
   }
   defer conn.Close()
   // Database operations...
   ```

4. Releasing resources in general:

   ```go
   resource := acquireResource()
   defer releaseResource(resource)
   // Use resource...
   ```

Key points about `defer`:
- Deferred function calls are executed in Last In First Out (LIFO) order.
- Deferred functions are called even if a panic occurs.
- The arguments to a deferred function are evaluated when the `defer` statement is executed, not when the function is called.

Using `defer` helps ensure that resources are properly released and clean-up operations are performed, even if errors occur, making your code more robust and less prone to resource leaks.
