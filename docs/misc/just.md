Ah, I see. You're asking about other web security concepts that are important to know in the context of software development and operations, similar to CSP and CORS. Here's a list of key security concepts that you should be familiar with:  
   
### 1. Authentication and Authorization  
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of a user or system before allowing access to a system or application.  
- **Authorization**: Determining what an authenticated user or system is permitted to do.  
   
### 2. Encryption and Cryptography  
- **Encryption**: Protecting data by converting it into a coded format that can only be read with a key.  
- **Cryptography**: The practice of secure communication, which includes encryption as well as hashing and digital signatures.  
   
### 3. SSL/TLS  
- **SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security)**: Protocols for establishing authenticated and encrypted links between networked computers, commonly used for secure communications over the internet.  
   
### 4. HTTP Security Headers  
- **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)**: A header that tells browsers to only use HTTPS for communication.  
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME-type sniffing and reduces the risk of drive-by downloads.  
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks by controlling whether your site can be embedded in an iframe.  
   
### 5. Session Management  
- Secure handling of user sessions, including session cookies, and protection against session hijacking and fixation.  
   
### 6. Input Validation and Sanitization  
- Ensuring user input is validated and sanitized to prevent common attacks such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Command Injection.  
   
### 7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- A vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users.  
   
### 8. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)  
- A type of attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated.  
   
### 9. Security Misconfiguration  
- Ensuring systems are configured properly to avoid vulnerabilities due to default settings, incomplete or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, and verbose error messages containing sensitive information.  
   
### 10. Software Composition Analysis (SCA)  
- Identifying and managing open source and third-party components to ensure they do not contain known vulnerabilities.  
   
### 11. OWASP Top 10  
- Familiarity with the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10, which is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.  
   
### 12. API Security  
- Understanding the specific security considerations for APIs, including rate limiting, API keys, OAuth, and token-based authentication.  
   
### 13. Data Protection and Privacy  
- Understanding data protection laws (such as GDPR, CCPA) and implementing best practices for data privacy and handling sensitive information.  
   
### 14. Incident Response  
- Having a plan for responding to security breaches, including detection, communication, and remediation steps.  
   
### 15. Threat Modeling  
- The process of identifying potential threats to a system and prioritizing the mitigation of those threats based on their risk.  
   
These topics cover a range of security concerns that are relevant to modern web development and operations. Each of these areas is complex and requires further study to fully understand and implement effectively. As a DevOps engineer, having a grasp of these concepts will help you build and maintain secure systems.
