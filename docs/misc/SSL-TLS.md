Certainly! Let's create a basic project that demonstrates the usage of SSL/TLS in a Go web server. We'll generate a self-signed SSL/TLS certificate and configure the server to use HTTPS.

Project: SSL/TLS with Go

Prerequisites:
- Go installed
- OpenSSL installed (for generating SSL/TLS certificates)

Step 1: Create a new directory for the project and navigate to it:
```
mkdir ssl-tls-example
cd ssl-tls-example
```

Step 2: Generate a self-signed SSL/TLS certificate using OpenSSL:
```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```
This command will generate two files: `key.pem` (private key) and `cert.pem` (self-signed certificate). You will be prompted to enter some information for the certificate, such as country, organization, etc. You can leave most fields blank by pressing Enter.

Step 3: Create a new file named `main.go` with the following code:
```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    // Configure the server
    server := &http.Server{
        Addr:    ":8443",
        Handler: http.HandlerFunc(handleRequest),
    }

    // Start the server with SSL/TLS
    log.Printf("Server is running on https://localhost:8443")
    log.Fatal(server.ListenAndServeTLS("cert.pem", "key.pem"))
}

func handleRequest(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.Write([]byte("Hello, SSL/TLS!"))
}
```

Step 4: Run the server:
```
go run main.go
```

Step 5: Open a web browser and visit `https://localhost:8443`. You should see the message "Hello, SSL/TLS!".

Note: Since we are using a self-signed certificate, the browser will display a warning about the certificate being untrusted. This is expected for self-signed certificates. In a production environment, you would use a certificate issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA).

Explanation:
- We create an `http.Server` instance and configure it to listen on port 8443 (default HTTPS port).
- The `handleRequest` function is set as the handler for all incoming requests. It simply writes the message "Hello, SSL/TLS!" to the response.
- We start the server using `server.ListenAndServeTLS("cert.pem", "key.pem")`, passing the paths to the SSL/TLS certificate and private key files.
- When you visit `https://localhost:8443` in a web browser, the server will respond with the message "Hello, SSL/TLS!" over a secure HTTPS connection.

By using SSL/TLS, the communication between the client (web browser) and the server is encrypted, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the data transmitted over the network.

Remember to use a trusted SSL/TLS certificate from a reputable certificate authority in a production environment to avoid browser warnings and establish trust with your users.

Note: The self-signed certificate generated in this example is for local development and testing purposes only. It should not be used in a production environment.

I hope this helps you understand the basics of using SSL/TLS in a Go web server! Let me know if you have any further questions.
