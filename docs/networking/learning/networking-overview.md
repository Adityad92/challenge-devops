3. **Get Comfortable with Network Security:**  
   - Firewalls and their configurations  
   - Network Access Control Lists (ACLs)  
   - VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) for secure remote connections  
   - Basics of IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems)  
   
4. **Learn Key Cloud Networking Services (for major providers like AWS, Azure, GCP):**  
   - Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and network segmentation  
   - Load balancers and auto-scaling  
   - CDN (Content Delivery Network) usage  
   - Network peering and gateways  
   
5. **Familiarize with Network Automation Tools:**  
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and CloudFormation

7. **Monitor and Troubleshoot Networks:**  
   - Network monitoring tools (e.g., Nagios, Zabbix, PRTG)  
   - Log management and analysis (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk)  
   - Network troubleshooting commands (e.g., ping, traceroute, netstat)  
   
8. **Embrace DevOps and Agile Methodologies:**  
   - Continuous integration and delivery as it applies to network changes  
   - Collaborative working with development and operations teams  
   - Iterative and incremental network improvements  
   
9. **Stay Updated and Keep Learning:**  
   - Follow the latest trends in networking technology  
   - Engage with the DevOps community for shared learning  
   - Regularly review and update your networking knowledge base  
   
By focusing on these areas, you will cover the essentials of networking within a DevOps context, allowing you to manage and automate networks effectively while continuously integrating networking considerations into the broader DevOps practice.
