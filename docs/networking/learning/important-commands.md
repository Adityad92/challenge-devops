Here are key mandatory networking commands that are essential for network management and troubleshooting across various operating systems:  
   
1. **ipconfig / ifconfig:**  
   - View and manage IP configuration on Windows (`ipconfig`) and Unix/Linux (`ifconfig`).  
   
2. **ping:**  
   - Test connectivity between your machine and another networked device.  
   
3. **traceroute / tracert:**  
   - Trace the path packets take to reach a network host (Unix/Linux: `traceroute`, Windows: `tracert`).  
   
4. **netstat:**  
   - Display network statistics, active connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.  
   
5. **nslookup / dig:**  
   - Query DNS servers to find DNS details, including IP addresses (Unix/Linux: `dig`, Windows: `nslookup`).  
   
6. **route:**  
   - View and modify the IP routing table on your system.  
   
7. **arp:**  
   - View and modify the system's ARP cache, which stores IP to MAC address mappings.  
   
8. **ssh:**  
   - Securely connect to and execute commands on a remote machine.  
   
9. **telnet:**  
   - Connect to a remote machine to test TCP connectivity on specified ports (less secure than SSH).  
   
10. **nmap:**  
    - Network scanning tool to discover devices and services on a network.  
   
11. **tcpdump / wireshark:**  
    - Capture and analyze network packets (command line: `tcpdump`, GUI: Wireshark).  
   
12. **nc (netcat):**  
    - Utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP.  
   
13. **iptables / firewalld / ufw:**  
    - Manage firewall rules to control network traffic (Linux-based systems).  
   
14. **curl / wget:**  
    - Transfer data from or to a server using various protocols (Unix/Linux: `curl` and `wget`, Windows: `curl`).  
   
15. **host:**  
    - Perform DNS lookups to resolve a domain name to an IP address or vice versa.  
   
16. **mtr:**  
    - Network diagnostic tool combining the functionality of `ping` and `traceroute`.  
   
17. **iperf:**  
    - Test network bandwidth between two hosts.  
   
These commands form the foundational toolkit for network administrators and are vital for diagnosing and resolving network issues. Knowing when and how to use them is crucial for effective network management.
