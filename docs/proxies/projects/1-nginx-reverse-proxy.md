Sure, I can provide you with a simple project setup using Docker Compose to create a reverse proxy with Nginx. This setup will include a reverse proxy container and a sample web application container. The reverse proxy will forward requests to the web application.  
   
First, let's create a directory structure for our project:  
   
```sh  
mkdir -p reverse-proxy-nginx/{nginx,webapp}  
cd reverse-proxy-nginx  
```  
   
Inside the `webapp` directory, create a simple `index.html` file:  
   
```html  
<!-- reverse-proxy-nginx/webapp/index.html -->  
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html lang="en">  
<head>  
    <meta charset="UTF-8">  
    <title>Sample Web Application</title>  
</head>  
<body>  
    <h1>Welcome to the Sample Web Application!</h1>  
</body>  
</html>  
```  
   
Next, create the Nginx configuration for the reverse proxy inside the `nginx` directory:  
   
```nginx  
# reverse-proxy-nginx/nginx/nginx.conf  
events {}  
   
http {  
    server {  
        listen 80;  
        location / {  
            proxy_pass http://webapp:80;  
            proxy_set_header Host $host;  
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;  
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;  
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;  
        }  
    }  
}  
```  
   
Now, let's create the `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of the `reverse-proxy-nginx` directory:  
   
```yaml  
# reverse-proxy-nginx/docker-compose.yml  
version: '3.8'  
   
services:  
  webapp:  
    image: nginx:latest  
    container_name: webapp  
    volumes:  
      - ./webapp/index.html:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html  
    networks:  
      - web_network  
  
  nginx:  
    image: nginx:latest  
    container_name: nginx_reverse_proxy  
    ports:  
      - "80:80"  
    volumes:  
      - ./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro  
    depends_on:  
      - webapp  
    networks:  
      - web_network  
   
networks:  
  web_network:  
    driver: bridge  
```  
   
This Docker Compose file defines two services: `webapp` and `nginx`. The `webapp` service is a simple Nginx container serving static content from our `webapp` directory. The `nginx` service uses a custom Nginx configuration to act as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests to the `webapp` service.  
   
To start the project, run the following command in the root of the `reverse-proxy-nginx` directory:  
   
```sh  
docker-compose up -d  
```  
   
Once the containers are running, you can access the sample web application by navigating to `http://localhost` in your web browser. The request will be automatically forwarded to the `webapp` container by the reverse proxy.  
   
Remember to replace `nginx:latest` with a specific version if you need a stable deployment. Using `latest` may lead to unexpected changes when new versions are released.  
   
This example is a basic setup. In a production environment, you would need to configure volumes for logs, handle SSL termination, and potentially scale the web application with multiple instances and a load balancer.
